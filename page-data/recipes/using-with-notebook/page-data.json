In the default Kubeflow welcome page, in the left side menu, click on `Notebook Servers`   \n  \n   ![Elyra](../images/ai/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-splash-screen.png)  \n  \n1. Click on `NEW SERVER`   \n  \n   ![Elyra](../images/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-notebook-server.png)  \n  \n1. Choose a `name` for your notebook server, and under `Image` check the box labeled `Custom Image`.   \n  \n   ![Elyra](../images/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-config-1.png)  \n\n1. In _Kubeflow version 1.3 (and later)_ choose `jupyterlab` as image type.\n\n1. As `Custom Image` enter `elyra/kf-notebook:<ELYRA_VERSION>`, replacing `<ELYRA_VERSION>` with the desired image tag, e.g. `2.1.0`.   \n  \n   ![Elyra](../images/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-image-config.png)\n\n   > To pull an image from quay.io prefix the image name with `quay.io`, e.g. `quay.io/kf-notebook:2.1.0`.  \n  \n1. Customize the resources as required. We recommend at least 1 CPU and 1Gi of memory.\n     \n1. Your notebook server with Elyra should begin the provisioning process now. When complete, you'll notice a green light and arrow to the left of your notebook.
