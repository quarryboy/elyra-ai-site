A file containing a widget is named after the widget (i.e. `PipelineEditorWidget.tsx` contains the class `PipelineEditorWidget`).\n\nFiles containing util functions are named generically after the utils functionality (i.e. if a util function returned a custom dialog, the file that contained that function would be called `dialog.tsx`).\n\nThe index file contains only the definition of the extension class and any other exports that the extension creates.\n## Import sections\nElyra extensions create separate sections for imports from different categories (i.e. all imports from `@jupyterlab` would be in a separate section from imports from `@lumino`). Sections are separated by a blank line. Each section is alphabetized by the name of packages.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"bb95ed518aab61902843eadf42143361","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":362},"frontmatter":{"title":"Conventions for contributing to Elyra Extensions","description":"Conventions for contributing to Elyra Extensions"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Conventions for contributing to Elyra Extensions\ndescription: Conventions for contributing to Elyra Extensions\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Conventions for contributing to Elyra Extensions\n  </span>\n);\n\n## File Naming and File Creation\n Elyra extensions use a separate file for each widget, and keep helper functions and classes in the file with that widget.
