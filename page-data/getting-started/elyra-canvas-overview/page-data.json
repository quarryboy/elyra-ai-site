These nodes may be styled as needed and use a toolbar located at the top of the UI which can use any number of configurations to account for the needs of the user. \n\nThe second section, **node properties**, may be edited via a side panel on the right side of the UI. Components that are included in the node properties are located on this site and use the Carbon Design System as its basis.\n\n## Glossary\n\nSome of the terms on this site may be quite specific. Find some of their definitions below.\n\n| Term | Definition |\n| -----|  -------|\n| Canvas | This is the active space that users may drag and drop elements onto. |\n| Consumer |These are the host applications that adopt the Elyra canvas experience. |\n| Node | These are draggable elements that users may move onto and across the canvas and configure.|\n| Flow  | Flow or streams are the nodes that exist on the canvas and are often connected to one another.|\n| Link | Links are the lines that run between nodes. They can serve a number of purposes. |\n| Palette | Found on the left side of the screen, the palette is where users can find nodes with which they will interact. |\n| Port | Ports are typically found on the outsides of nodes and are connection points for links. |\n| Properties | These are the configurable bits of the nodes.
