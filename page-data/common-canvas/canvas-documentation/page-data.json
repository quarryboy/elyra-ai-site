A regular JavaScript object called <a href=\"canvas-controller/canvas-controller-api\">CanvasController</a>. The CanvasController routes calls from the host application and calls made due to user interactions into the system. In particular it updates the internal ObjectModel which stores:\n    - the data that describes the flow of nodes, links and comments (called a pipelineFlow);\n    - the data that describes the definition of the palette which contains new nodes that can be added to the canvas;\n    - the set of currently selected objects.\n    - notification messages\n    - breadcrumbs that indicate which sub-flow is being viewed\n    - layout information\n\n<br />\n\nThe CanvasController provides an API which allows your code to:\n* set a new pipelineFlow;\n* get the current pipelineFlow (after the user has edited it);\n* update and edit objects in the canvas (for example, add node, delete link etc.);\n* set the node definition data (for display of nodes in the palette)\n\n\n## First steps\n\n### Hello Canvas!\n\nYou can start by looking at these two 'hello world' examples for using common canvas:\n\n* This first one called <a href=\"https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/master/canvas_modules/harness/src/client/App_tiny.js\">App_tiny.js</a> has the bare minimum necessary to get a fully functioning common-canvas to appear including all the basic functionality, a palette and a flow of nodes and links.\n*  The second, called <a href=\"https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/master/canvas_modules/harness/src/client/App_small.js\">App_small.js</a>, shows many of the options available to a common-canvas developer such as configurations and callback handlers.\n\nNow let's walk through the different parts of these files:\n\n### Step 1: Import\n\nTo use common canvas in your react application you need to do the following. First import the CommonCanvas react component and CanvasController class from the common-canvas library. There are two import options. If you plan to use common properties along with the canvas functionality then use this import option:\n\n<br />\n\n#### All Components\n\n```import { CommonCanvas, CanvasController } from \"@elyra/canvas\";```\n\n<br />\n\n#### Canvas only\n\n\nIf you want to use just the canvas functionality and not common-properties you can use this import option:\n\n```import { CommonCanvas, CanvasController } from \"@elyra/canvas/dist/lib/canvas\";```\n\nIn addition you'll need to import ```<IntlProvider>``` from the react-intl library.\n\n```import { IntlProvider } from \"react-intl\";```\n\n<br />\n\n### Step 2 : Create an instance of the canvas controller\n\nTo control the canvas you'll need an instance of the canvas controller so create an instance of it like this (probably in the constructor of your object).\n\n```this.canvasController = new CanvasController();```\n<br />\n\n### Step 3 : Set the model and palette data\n\nNext you'll need to populate the model data by calling CanvasController with:\n\n```this.canvasController.setPipelineFlowPalette(pipelineFlowPalette);```\n```this.canvasController.setPipelineFlow(pipelineFlow);```\n\nThe pipelineFlowPalette object should conform to the JSON schema found here: https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/tree/master/common-canvas/palette\n\nThe pipelineFlow object should conform to the JSON schema found here: https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/tree/master/common-pipeline/pipeline-flow\n\n<br /> \n\n### Step 4 : Pull in the CSS\n\nCheck <a href=\"/common-properties/styling\">this section</a> to find info on what CSS to include in your application's CSS. \n\n<br />\n\n### Step 5 : Display the canvas\n\n\nFinally you'll need to display the canvas object inside an `<IntlProvider>` object. Inside your render code, add the following:\n\n```\n    <div>\n        <IntlProvider>\n            <CommonCanvas canvasController={this.canvasController} />\n        </IntlProvider>\n    </div>\n```\n\nThe div should have the dimensions you want for your canvas to display in your page. For the canvasController property, pass the instance of canvas controller you created earlier. This is the only mandatory property. After providing this and running your code you will have a fully functioning canvas including default toolbar, context menus direct manipulation (move and resize) etc. To customize these behaviors and presentation continue with the sections below.\n\n#### Common Canvas customization\n\nIf you want to customize the behavior of common canvas you can specify any combination of the following settings:\n\n```\n    <div>\n        <CommonCanvas\n            canvasController={this.canvasController}\n            config={this.commonCanvasConfig}\n            toolbarConfig={this.toolbarConfig}\n            notificationConfig={this.notificationConfig}\n            contextMenuConfig={this.contextMenuConfig}\n            keyboardConfig={this.keyboardConfig}\n            contextMenuHandler={this.contextMenuHandler}\n            beforeEditActionHandler={this.beforeEditActionHandler}\n            editActionHandler={this.editActionHandler}    \n            clickActionHandler={this.clickActionHandler}   \n            decorationActionHandler={this.decorationActionHandler}\n            layoutHandler={this.layoutHandler}  \n            tipHandler={this.tipHandler}\n            idGeneratorHandler={this.idGeneratorHandler}\n            selectionChangeHandler={this.selectionChangeHandler}\n            showRightFlyout={showRightFlyout}\n            rightFlyoutContent={rightFlyoutContent}\n        >\n        </CommonCanvas>\n    </div>\n```\n\n<br />\n\n#### Config objects\n\nCommon canvas has five optional configuration objects: config, toolbarConfig, notificationConfig, contextMenuConfig and keyboardConfig. They are documented <a href=\"config/canvas-config\">here</a>.\n\n#### Handlers\n\nThere are several optional handlers implemented as callback functions. They are contextMenuHandler, editActionHandler, beforeEditActionHandler, clickActionHandler, decorationActionHandler, layoutHandler, tipHandler, idGeneratorHandler and selectionChangeHandler. They are documented <a href=\"callbacks\">here</a>.\n\n#### Right-flyout panel parameters\n\nThere are two optional parameters to let you manage the right flyout panel which can be used to display properties for objects etc. These are:\n\n* showRightFlyout: This can be true or false to indicate whether the flyout panel is shown or not. The default is false.\n* rightFlyoutContent: content to display in the right flyout which is a JSX object. Nothing is displayed by default.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Localization\n\nYou can customize `<CommonCanvas>` using the `<IntlProvider>` object to display translated test\nCreating nodes on the canvas\n\nNodes can be created on the canvas by the user in two ways:\n\n* By dragging a node from the palette onto the canvas background\n* By dragging a node from outside the canvas\n\nThe first technique is provided by Common canvas. The second requires some development work which is documented <a href=\"enabling-external-node-creation\">here</a>. \n\n<br />\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nCommon canvas supports a number of keyboard interactions as follows:\n\n| Key |                    Action |\n| ---                    | ------ |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + A          | Select All objects   |\n| Delete                  | Delete selected objects |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + Z           | Undo last command |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z   | Redo last undone command |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + Y           | Redo last undone command |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + X          | Cut selected objects to the clipboard |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + C          | Copy selected objects to the clipboard |\n| Ctrl/Cmd + V           | Paste objects from the clipboard |\n\n\nYour application can disable any or all of these actions by providing the <a href=\"/common-canvas/config/keyboard-config\">keyboard config object</a> to the CommonCanvas react component.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4d7d1e0f9287deba2f78d91409c40f6f","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":409},"frontmatter":{"title":"Canvas components","description":"Canvas components"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Canvas components\ndescription: Canvas components\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe Elyra test harness (http://ibm.biz/elyra-canvas) allows consumers to explore a number of configurations of both the canvas as well as properties.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You must be on an IBM network to access the test harness.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n\n\nCommon canvas displays a flow of data operations as nodes and links which the user can create and edit to get the flow they want.
