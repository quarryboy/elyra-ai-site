That means, properties that are in `<object>.app_data.ui_data `are flattened out and appear as properties in the `<object>` itself. So for example a node that conforms to the schema might look like this:\n\n```\n    {\n      id: \"1234\",\n      op: \"select\",\n      ...\n      app_data : {\n        ui_data: {\n          label: \"Selection node\",\n          image: \"/images/select.svg\",\n          description: \"A node for selection\"\n          ...\n        },\n        other_data: {\n          prop1: \"Something interesting\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n```\n\nwhereas when it is passed through the API it looks like this:\n\n```\n    {\n      id: \"1234\",\n      op: \"select\",\n      label: \"Selection node\",\n      image: \"/images/select.svg\",\n      description: \"A node for selection\"\n      ...\n      app_data : {\n        other_data: {\n          prop1: \"Something interesting\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n```\n\nNote that, any properties in `app_data,` other than `ui_data`, are preserved in the internal format. So in the example, `app_data.other_data` in the schema format is preserved in the internal format.\n\n\n## Links handing in the API\n\nThe other difference between the API and the schema formats is with links.\n\nIn the schema, links are defined as properties within another object, for example, a node to node link is defined within a `links` array inside the `inputs` field of the target node and contains references to the `node id` and `port` of the source node.\n\nHowever, in the API, links are treated as a top level object; that is, there is an array of links stored internally which can be manipulated using the API methods.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"46b5b66eeebe0ab132564f934998ca58","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":418},"frontmatter":{"title":"API Object structure","description":"API Object structure","tabs":["Canvas controller API","Style spec","Decorator spec","API Object structure","Notification spec"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: API Object structure\ndescription: API Object structure\ntabs: ['Canvas controller API', 'Style spec', 'Decorator spec', 'API Object structure', 'Notification spec']\n\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nBecause historically, common-canvas has had to deal with different external flow definitions, there are some differences between the nodes, comments, and links that the CanvasController API deals with and those specified in the pipelineFlow schema. \n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks >\n\n  <AnchorLink>Object structure</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Links handing in the API\n</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n\n## Object structure\n\nFor the API methods that involve nodes, comments and links, those objects are passed in and out by the API in their internal formats rather than the formats defined in the schema files.\n\nThe internal structure is a somewhat flattened version of that in the schema definition.
